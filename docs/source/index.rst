Welcome to snr's documentation!
===============================

Starting out, you can read :doc:`user_guide/installation` to install snr and then dive into :doc:`user_guide/quickstart` to get started!

Also you might want to read the :doc:`user_guide/faq` for commonly asked questions. After that you might want to get a more deeper knowledge of snr with reading :doc:`user_guide/deeper_introduction` and :doc:`user_guide/shell_commands`.

For details on how to protect your devices from snr (and similar physical-based attacks), you can read :doc:`user_guide/protection`.

If you are interesting in developing your own payloads do not forget to read our dedicated payload development guide (:doc:`dev_guide/payload_development/develop_your_own`)!
