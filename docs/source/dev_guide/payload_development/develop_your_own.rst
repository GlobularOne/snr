Develop Your Own Payload
========================

Snr payloads are simply python modules that are expected to behave in a certain way. 
So if you want to develop your own payload, you need to know some python.
However the original payload it will run does not need to be written in python.
This guide assumes you already know some basics of python and also have at least read some of the user guides.

Here you can see a list of the order we recommend you to read the payload development guides:

1. :doc:`terminology` (I know it doesn't look serious, but it is required for you to understand the text so be sure to not skip it.)
2. :doc:`basics`
3. :doc:`payload_class`
4. :doc:`payload_types`
5. :doc:`working_example`
6. :doc:`validation`
7. :doc:`partition_types`
8. :doc:`contributing_a_payload`
