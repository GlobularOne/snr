# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Generally, only the last two minor releases are supported for security updating (which often means stable and *beta*, or stable and *development* version depending on the circumstances). However this policy might be slightly altered if the development team has noticed that a specific release, no matter how old is of significant importance. Here is the table for current situation (which should be consulted, not the general rule):

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.x.x   | :x:                |
| 1.0.x   | :x:                |
| 1.1.x   | :x:                |
| 1.2.x   | :x:                |
| 1.3.x   | :x:                |
| 1.4.x   | :x:                |
| 1.5.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.6.x   | :white_check_mark: |

*0.x.x versions are commonly called `Legacy`.*

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, you should absolutely not use any public means to do so. You must contact me at <GlobularOne@proton.me> to notify me of a vulnerability privately. Once the vulnerability is patched up (which usually means a new release with a patch), you can publicize your vulnerability as your honest work at whatever medium you prefer. We will happily credit the discovery of the vulnerability to you at public. This policy ensures we have no publicly known vulnerability that we have not patched up yet.

### My vulnerability got rejected

We may reach the conclusion that the bug you have found is not a vulnerability by itself. In this case, we may reject the vulnerability report and ask you to report it to us for a public issue at [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/GlobularOne/snr/issues). This ensures all communication that should be public remains public.
